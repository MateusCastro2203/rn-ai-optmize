- **Batch Mode Flag**: New `--batch` flag for enabling parallel processing mode

#### Interactive Experience Improvements

- **Comprehensive Interactive Menu**: Enhanced user interface with clear navigation and intuitive options
- **Flexible Analysis Types**: Choose from single screen, component, multiple files, service, utility, or specific file analysis
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Option to use default settings or customize model, language, project type, and version
- **Real-time Validation**: Input validation for file paths and directory existence

#### Advanced Report Organization

- **Directory-Based Organization**: Reports are now organized by parent folder names for better project structure reflection
